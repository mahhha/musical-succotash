  Hello,
  I am Yashaswini M, I am a B.E graduate in the field of Medical Electronics, I have received training and certification in Core Java, SQL and Front-End technologies like HTML5,CSS and JavaScript and recently started training on J2EE.
  Since I am a newbie to J2EE I am not familiar with several API's like REST, or elastic search therefore I have finished my assignment to the best of my knowledge I have gained in the little time I have spent with J2EE, please excuse me if the assignment is not exactly as you have expected it to be. Be assured that if provided a chance I will definitely prove myself by learning and showcasing my skills and will not disappoint the organization and I will prove to be an asset to the company.
  Thanks.
